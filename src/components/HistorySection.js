        Amharic term ‘Kene Mahilet’, is the name for the place found in the
        entrance of the temple, having three doors each for the entry of
        Priests, men and women. The southeast side is the entrance for women. In
        this Holy place, 1. Priests and singers perform songs of Mahilet
        (Yaredik hymn). 2. On the northeast corner side of, Priests and Deacons
        perform ‘Seatate’/ liturgy performed on each nights of fasting seasons
        and ‘Kidan’ (everyday night and morning prayer) 3. Men laities perform
        ‘Divine Liturgy’ in this holy place. Holy The middle part or the center
        of the Holy Church is known as ‘Holy.’ It has the following function. 1.
        It is a holy place where laities (Christians/children, elderly people,
        young men and women/) partake in the Holy Communion/eat the flesh and
        drink the blood of The Holy son Lord and Savior Jesus Christ). 2.
        Priests teach in this holy place. 3. It is also a place where the prayer

        Priests and Deacons stand on the North, South, West and East in it. It
        has four doors each. Only those who part take in the Holy Communion
        stand inside during the Divine Liturgy (Qidase). Temple This is the
        place where the Arc of the covenant is found. It was called the ‘Holy of
        Holies’ during the Old Testament. Holy Icons, Holy Scriptures and Holy
        instruments are also found in this place. It has three doors in the
